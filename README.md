# WordLadderPuzzleSolver-BFS
A mini project that solves the Word Ladder Puzzle using the Breadth-First Search algorithm in python
üìò Introduction

The Word Ladder Puzzle Solver is a Python-based mini-project that demonstrates how to find the shortest transformation sequence from a start word to an end word by changing only one letter at a time. Each intermediate word must also be a valid English word. The project uses the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to explore possible transformations efficiently.

üéØ Goal

The main goal of this project is to implement a program that finds the shortest path between two words using BFS, ensuring every intermediate word exists in a given dictionary.

üß† Theoretical Background

The Word Ladder problem is a classic example of a shortest-path problem in an unweighted graph. Each word is treated as a node, and an edge connects two words if they differ by exactly one letter. Using Breadth-First Search (BFS) helps find the minimum number of transformations required to convert one word into another. This approach guarantees an optimal solution since BFS explores all possible paths level by level.

‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm

Start with the initial word and add it to a queue.

Explore all possible one-letter transformations of the current word.

For each valid transformation found in the dictionary, add it to the queue.

Continue the process until the target word is found.

Return the sequence of words representing the shortest transformation path.

üíª Implementation (Python Code)
from collections import deque

def word_ladder(start, end, word_list):
    word_set = set(word_list)
    queue = deque([(start, [start])])
    
    while queue:
        word, path = queue.popleft()
        if word == end:
            return path
        
        for i in range(len(word)):
            for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
                next_word = word[:i] + c + word[i+1:]
                if next_word in word_set:
                    word_set.remove(next_word)
                    queue.append((next_word, path + [next_word]))
    return None

# Example Usage
word_list = ["hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log", "cog"]
result = word_ladder("hit", "cog", word_list)

if result:
    print("Shortest transformation path:", result)
else:
    print("No transformation found.")

üßæ Output Explanation

If you run this code, the output will be:

Shortest transformation path: ['hit', 'hot', 'dot', 'dog', 'cog']


This means the BFS algorithm successfully found the shortest path from ‚Äúhit‚Äù to ‚Äúcog‚Äù through valid intermediate words.

üß© Result

The project successfully demonstrates the use of Breadth-First Search in solving word transformation puzzles efficiently. It finds the shortest and most optimal path between two given words.

üöÄ Future Enhancements

Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better visualization.

Include a larger English dictionary for more flexibility.

Extend the program to handle multiple end words or user input through files.

Optimize for performance using bidirectional BFS.
